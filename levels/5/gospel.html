	<!-- Exodus 12:1,3 -->
	<p>The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world.  He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.  He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-5-2" class="section">
	<!-- Exodus 12:5-6 -->
	<p>Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God— children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-5-3" class="section">
	<p>The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>
	<p>Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-5-4" class="section">
	<!-- Exodus 12:7,11b -->
	<p>But now apart from the law the righteousness of God has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify.  This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-5-5" class="section">
	<p>God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-5-6" class="section">
	<!-- Exodus 12:12-13 -->
	<p>Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!  For if, while we were God's enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through his life!</p>
</div>
<div id="section-5-7" class="section">
	<!-- Exodus 12:29 -->
	<p>Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people. </p>
</div>
<div id="section-5-8" class="section">
	<!-- Exodus 12:33 -->
	<p>The law was brought in so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
