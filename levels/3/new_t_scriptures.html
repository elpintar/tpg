  <!-- Luke 2:9-18 -->
  <p>An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger."</p>
  <p>Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</p>
  <p>"Glory to God in the highest heaven,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests."</p>
  <p>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."</p>
  <p>So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.</p>

  <!-- John 19:12-22 -->
  <p>Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, "If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar."</p>
  <p>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge's seat.</p>
  <p>"Here is your king," Pilate said to the Jews.</p>
  <p>But they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!"</p>
  <p>"Shall I crucify your king?" Pilate asked.</p>
  <p>"We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests answered.</p>
  <p>Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified.</p>
  <p>So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull. There they crucified him, and with him two others — one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</p>
  <p>Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews". The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews."</p>
  <p>Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</p>

  <!-- Mark 10:46-52 -->
  <p>Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus, was sitting by the roadside begging. When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</p>
  <p>Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</p>
  <p>Jesus stopped and said, "Call him."</p>
  <p>So they called to the blind man, "Cheer up! On your feet! He’s calling you." Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus.</p>
  <p>"What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked him.</p>
  <p>The blind man said, "Rabbi, I want to see."</p>
  <p>"Go," said Jesus, "your faith has healed you." Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.</p>

  <!-- John 14:15-21 -->
  <p>[Jesus said,] "If you love me, keep my commands. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever— the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither sees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you. Before long, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live. On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you. Whoever has my commands and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and show myself to them."</p>

  <!-- Hebrews 7:22-28 -->
  <p>Jesus (Yeshua) has become the guarantor of a better covenant.</p>
  <p>Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because Jesus (Yeshua) lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood. Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them.</p>
  <p>Such a high priest truly meets our need—one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens. Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself. For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.</p>

<div id="section-matthew" class="section" style="display:none;">
  <!-- Matthew 1:18-21 -->
  <p>This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.</p>
  <p>But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus (Yeshua), because he will save his people from their sins."</p>
