  <!-- Micah 5:2 -->
  <p>But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;though you are small among the clans of Judah,</p>
  <p>out of you will come for me</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;one who will be ruler over Israel,</p>
  <p>whose origins are from of old,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;from ancient times.</p>

  <!-- Isaiah 53:4-6 -->
  <p>Surely he took up our pain</p>
  <p>&nbsp;and bore our suffering,</p>
  <p>yet we considered him punished by God,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;stricken by him, and afflicted.</p>
  <p>But he was pierced for our transgressions,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;he was crushed for our iniquities;</p>
  <p>the punishment that brought us peace was on him,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;and by his wounds we are healed.</p>
  <p>We all, like sheep, have gone astray,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;each of us has turned to our own way;</p>
  <p>and the Lord has laid on him</p>
  <p>&nbsp;the iniquity of us all.</p>

  <!-- Isaiah 35:4-10-->
  <p>&nbsp;"Be strong, do not fear;</p>
  <p>your God will come,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;he will come with vengeance;</p>
  <p>with divine retribution</p>
  <p>&nbsp;he will come to save you."</p>
  <p>Then will the eyes of the blind be opened</p>
  <p>&nbsp;and the ears of the deaf unstopped.</p>
  <p>Then will the lame leap like a deer,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;and the mute tongue shout for joy.</p>
  <p>Water will gush forth in the wilderness</p>
  <p>&nbsp;and streams in the desert.</p>
  <p>The burning sand will become a pool,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;the thirsty ground bubbling springs.</p>

  <p>"'For I will take you out of the nations; I will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land.

I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws. Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors; you will be my people, and I will be your God.'"</p>

  <p>Now Yeshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel. The angel said to those who were standing before him, "Take off his filthy clothes."</p>
  <p>Then he said to Yeshua, "See, I have taken away your sin, and I will put fine garments on you."</p>
  <p>The angel of the Lord gave this charge to Yeshua: "This is what the Lord Almighty says: 'If you will walk in obedience to me and keep my requirements, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you a place among these standing here.</p>
  <p>"'Listen, High Priest Yeshua, you and your associates seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch. See, the stone I have set in front of Yeshua! There are seven eyes on that one stone, and I will engrave an inscription on it,' says the Lord Almighty, 'and I will remove the sin of this land in a single day.</p>
